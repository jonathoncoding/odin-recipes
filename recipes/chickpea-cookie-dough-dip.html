  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>No more guilty nights sobbing over cookie dough, wondering if you'll die of salmonella! As far as desserts go there aren't many that can replace the nostalgic warm fuzzy glow of a solid chocolate chip cookie. Except eating the dough before ever getting to the baking step, which is the whole point of this recipe. Plus it's healthier (and less of a gamble) than eating actual raw cookie dough. </p>

  <h3>Ingredients for chickpea cookie dough dip</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups chickpeas</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 cup nut butter of choice</li>
    <li>up to 1/4 cup milk of choice, only if needed</li>
    <li>Sweetener (2/3 cup brown sugar, or 3 - 4 tbsp of pure maple syrup)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup choclate chips</li>
    <li>2 - 4 tbsp oats, flaxmeal, or almond flour (to thicken)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine all ingredients except the chocolate chips in a food processor, and blend until completely smooth.</li>
    <li>Stir in the chocolate-chips, then serve with your delivery-vehicle of choice (e.g., graham crackers, other cookies, there's no judgment here).</li>
  </ol>
